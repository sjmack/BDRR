Description: This package contains one function -- relRisk() -- that calculates relative risk (RR), associated confidence intervals and p-values for data frames or datafiles of case-control genotype data formatted for use with the Bridging Immunogenomic Data Analysis Workflow Gaps (BIGDAWG) R package. RR statistics are calculated for all alleles and genotypes at each locus, and are returned as a list object or can be written as individual tab-delimited text files.
